# Modern Calculator Application (Scutoids Calculator V3.0)

## Describe
This is a personal project for Hong Kong College of Technology in March-April 2025. The school requires students to be free to develop applications. After thinking for a while, I decided to develop a modern calculator application that allows users to perform numerical calculations, solve application problems and analyze data. The application combines front-end technologies (Ionic and Angular) with back-end technologies (PHP, MySQL and Python), integrates Mistral AI API to realize application calculation and data analysis functions, and uses MySQL to store user feedback, successfully demonstrating full-end development capabilities.

## Technology used
- **front end**: Ionic Framework, Angular, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
- **rear end**: PHP, MySQL, WampServer, Python
- **AI Integration**: Mistral AI API

## Functions
- Numerical calculation: Supports basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and scientific calculations.
- Text problem calculation: Parse and solve mathematical problems described in text through Mistral AI API.
- Data analysis: Use Python to perform data acquisition and data cleaning and use linear regression to predict data
- User feedback storage: Store user-submitted feedback in the MySQL database.

## Version
There are three versions of this app: 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. Why so many versions? Because this app is a school project, I spent a lot of time thinking about what features it should have, or which features need more time to design. Once I decided or completed the features, I added them to the app. I decided to split it into multiple versions, adding new features that I thought of in each version, so that I can incorporate my ideas into the app.

- Version 1.0

This is an initial version.
 
- Version 2.0
  
Support history record, users can view their personal calculation history.
