# Modern Calculator Application

## Describe
This project is a school project of Hong Kong College of Technology from March to April 2025. Students are free to develop applications, so I decided to develop a modern calculator application that allows users to perform numerical calculations, solve application problems and analyze data. The application combines front-end technologies (Ionic and Angular) with back-end technologies (PHP, MySQL and Python), integrates Mistral AI API to realize application calculation and data analysis functions, and uses MySQL to store user feedback, successfully demonstrating full-end development capabilities.

## Technology used
- **front end**: Ionic Framework, Angular, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
- **rear end**: PHP, MySQL, WampServer
- **AI Integration**: Mistral AI API

## Functions
- Numerical calculation: Supports basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and scientific calculations.
- Text problem calculation: Parse and solve mathematical problems described in text through Mistral AI API.
- Data analysis: Use Python to perform data acquisition and data cleaning and use linear regression to predict data
- User feedback storage: Store user-submitted feedback in the MySQL database.
